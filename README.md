Game Overview
I tried to make an RPG type of game in which a player is able to fight and level up to defeat monsters and bosses to progress in the story
I made 2 characters in which the player is able to choose from, between Jake the Brains (Who is a mage) and Derrick the Brawn (who is a babrabrian) each with their own set of abilities.
There are 3 chapters to this story in which the first is a tutorial, the second chapter is just simply playing the game and the third chapter is the final boss.

System Requirements: Python 3.7 or newer

Folder Structure: 
gvars.py = world events
Character.py = All characters in the game
Combat.py = How the combat will work in the game
Start.py = Start of game, choosing character
Outskirts.py = Chapter 1
Woods.py = Chapter 2
Labyrinth.py - Chapter 3
Finale.py = Final Boss

How to Run the Game: Make sure you have Python version 3.7 or newer installed. Download the files and make sure all files are in the same folder. Open terminal or command prompt. Run the game by running it on python with the trinagle symbol on the top right corner 

Game Features:
Modular Design: Each chapter is a separate file
Randomness: The games combat is basically rock, paper, scissors making combat partly RNG
Progression: You can level up your character leading up to bigger stats
